# Betacode to Unicode Ancient Greek converter

Betacode to Unicode ancient greek converter based on RegEx. 
The script is ready to process the file "plat.tet1_gk.xml" downloaded from Perseus Project (https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/download). 
Some adjustments would be necessary in order to use it to process any other file.
